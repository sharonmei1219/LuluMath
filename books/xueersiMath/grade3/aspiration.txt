Speaking of aspiration, it really depends on opportunity.
What really matters is how competetive we are to grasp the opportunity.
And how our inspiration and competence to make opportunity being value adding to both our organization and myself.
To our orgnization, value adding means more attractive product, and more profit.
To me, value adding means a clear view in career development.

Now, the situation in telecom is very hash, and opportunity is very rare, thus, we need to fight really hard to seek one and grasp one. 

我想把aspiration 引到 opportunity上，然后强调下自己的学习能力，最后就是要change自己，而不是按自己的aspiration去找机会

如果一定要说自己有什么preference,那么就做customer和R&D的bridge，可以influence顾客与可以influence R&D，save 研发成本，给顾客更好的产品及solution
